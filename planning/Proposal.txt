The plan is to make a travel planning website to be able to keep all your planned expenses and activities in one spot. The
app is to create a form where you can add travel plans to list and then have the total cost of all the activities added
together and subtracted from the total budget. The list of plans and budget is to be saved in a database for retrivial
Using a post function. When the page loads the website will run a get function to pull data from the database to display 
on the web page.


MVP:
	(Post) Add new Travel plans
	(get) load travel plans from database on page load
	(post) set budget
Stretch goals:
	(put) the ability to edit plans
	(put) the ability to rearrange plans
	(delete) the ability to delete plans

Specific requirements and how I plan to achive them:
	app has at least 5 semantic tags- 
		<Header> for the top header of the web page
		<aside> for the budget section of the header
		<main> for the bottom section of the page that contains the 3 primary sections
		<section> for the 3 main sections of the page (set budget, add plan, and display plans)
		<ul> for the list of plans
		<li> for each list item
		<form> for the set budget function and the add plan function
		<input> for each input of the forms
		<button> the two submit buttons
